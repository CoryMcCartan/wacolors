# Colorblind-friendly Palettes from Washington State

The `wacolor` package contains `r length(wacolors::wacolors)` color palettes
taken from the landscapes and cities of Washington state. Each color was
extracted from a photograph, with minor alterations made to improve balance 
and desaturability. The palettes were evaluated by the color-blind author to
ensure colors are distinguishable, but some palettes risk more confusion than
others, especially at small scales.

## Installation
<!-- You can install the released version of wacolors from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
You can install `wacolors` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/wacolors@release")
```

## Usage
It's easy to select a palette. Access palettes through `wacolors$...` for
autocompletion suggestions.
```{r}
library(wacolors)
library(ggplot2)

# See all palettes
names(wacolors)

# See one palette
wacolors$rainier
```

The package comes with `ggplot2`-compatible scales which are easy to use.
```{r ggplot}
# access by name
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl), size=hp)) +
    scale_color_wa_d("seattle_night")

# or access using `wacolors$...`
ggplot(diamonds) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
    scale_fill_wa_d(wacolors$sound_sunset, reverse=TRUE)
```

You can use the `wa_pal` function to directly construct a discretized/binned
color scale.
```{r heatmap}
image(volcano, col=wa_pal("ferries", 12))
image(volcano, col=wa_pal("volcano", 80, reverse=TRUE))
```

### Code Generation
In case you do not wish to have `wacolors` as a dependency, you may use the 
`pal_vector()` and `pal_functions()` functions, which generate self-contained
code for using the palettes.  When using RStudio, this code will be loaded,
ready to copy, at the console prompt.
```{r}
pal_vector("sound_sunset", 15)

pal_functions("locks")
```

## The Palettes

### Continuous Palettes
```{r cont-palettes, echo=F, fig.height=1, out.width=NULL}
cont_pal = c("sound_sunset", "understory", "winter_mountain", 
             "ferries", "volcano", "locks", "plane_view")

for (pal in cont_pal) {
    plot(wa_pal(pal))
}
```

### All Palettes
```{r disc-palettes, echo=F, fig.height=1, out.width=NULL}
for (pal in names(wacolors)) {
    plot(wa_pal(pal))
}
```
