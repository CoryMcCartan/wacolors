Description:  Color palettes taken from the landscapes and cities of Washington 
    state. Each color was extracted from a photograph, with minor alterations 
    made to improve balance.  The palettes were evaluated by the color-blind 
    author to ensure colors are distinguishable, but some palettes risk more 
    confusion than others.
